To complete an image compressing app project, here is a list of libraries, languages, platforms, frameworks, hardware, books, and resources that can be helpful:

Languages:
1. Python (for backend development and image processing)
2. JavaScript (for frontend development and web-based image compression)

Backend Frameworks and Libraries:
1. Flask or Django (Python frameworks for web development)
2. Node.js (JavaScript runtime for server-side development)
3. Pillow (Python library for image processing)
4. Express.js (Node.js framework for building web applications)

Frontend Frameworks and Libraries:
1. React.js or Vue.js (JavaScript frameworks for building user interfaces)
2. HTML and CSS (for structuring and styling the frontend)

Platforms:
1. Web: You can develop a web-based image compression app accessible from browsers.
2. Mobile: Develop a native mobile app for iOS and Android platforms.

Hardware:
1. Computer: A computer capable of running the required software and development tools.

Books and Resources:
1. "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes: A beginner-friendly book to learn Python programming.
2. "Flask Web Development with Python Tutorial" (on Flask) or "Django for Beginners" (on Django): Resources for learning web development with Python frameworks.
3. "Eloquent JavaScript" by Marijn Haverbeke: A comprehensive guide to JavaScript programming.
4. Documentation: Refer to official documentation of libraries, frameworks, and platforms you choose for detailed information and examples.
5. Online tutorials and guides: Websites like MDN Web Docs, Real Python, and Dev.to offer tutorials and articles on various aspects of web development and image processing.

Additional Resources:
1. GitHub: Use version control and collaborate with others on your project.
2. Stack Overflow: Online community for programming-related questions and answers.
3. CodePen or JSFiddle: Online code editors to quickly prototype and test JavaScript and HTML/CSS code snippets.
4. Online image compression APIs: Explore existing image compression APIs like TinyPNG, Cloudinary, or imgix that provide compression services and APIs for integration.

Remember, the specific libraries, frameworks, and resources you choose will depend on your preferred language, platform, and development approach. Be sure to consult relevant documentation and adapt the tools and resources to fit your project requirements.
