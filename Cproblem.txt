Problem:
The image compressing app aims to solve the problem of large file sizes associated with images. Many images captured by digital cameras or generated by graphic design tools tend to have high resolutions and file sizes, which can cause issues when sharing or uploading them. Large image files consume significant storage space, require more bandwidth for transmission, and may take longer to load on websites or mobile apps. The project intends to address this problem by providing a solution for users to compress images without significant loss of quality.

Limitations:
While the image compressing app focuses on reducing the file size of images, it will not solve issues related to image content or quality improvement. It does not offer advanced image editing capabilities, such as retouching, filters, or effects. The primary purpose of the project is to optimize image file size for better storage, transmission, and loading times.

Users and Beneficiaries:
The image compressing app can be beneficial to a wide range of users, including:
1. Photographers: They can compress high-resolution images captured by their cameras to reduce file sizes without compromising much on visual quality.
2. Web developers: They can optimize images for websites and applications to improve loading times, especially for mobile users with limited bandwidth.
3. Graphic designers: They can compress images generated by design software to make them more manageable for sharing or embedding in projects.
4. Social media users: They can compress images before posting them on social media platforms to minimize file size and improve upload speed.
5. Mobile app developers: They can integrate image compression into their apps to minimize storage requirements and enhance the overall user experience.

Locale:
The image compressing app is not specific to any particular locale. It can be used globally by users from different countries and regions. The need for image compression and optimization is universal, regardless of geographical location. The app's functionality and benefits are not dependent on a specific locale.
